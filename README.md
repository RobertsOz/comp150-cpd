* I have gotten into the rythm of the course.
* I need to focus on Futher learning and Planning ahead for Term 2


#Stage 2
## Week 1

I missed the introduction to comp 140, because the time table didnt say that it was a comp 140 session.
I had no problem with the comp 130 worksheet A it was fairly easy. Encountered no problems.

## Week 2

Week 1 and Week 2 feels like a buffer before the real course starts. With Comp 130 being an introduction to C++ coding standarts. Didn't quite understand what the UML diagrams would be useful for.

## Week 3

Week 3 we handed in the Mandle brot set worksheet. I had some problems in the beggining wraping my head around the maths of it and where should it go in code, so I looked at an example online just to see where the calculation is supposed to go. For the color we were allowed to take code from online as long as we commented where we got it from, it was difficult looking at someone elses code and figuring out how to use it. For the strech goal I managed to get the zoom function working but only on the first coordinate. For some reason whenever I tried to recalculate the coordinates after a zoom the screen would not go where it is supposed to, and I never ended up fixing this problem. 

We were give adruinos but told nothing about how to work with them so Im kind of confused what to do with them.

Introduction to design patters, Im very keen to finding ways to implement this into my projects, but I also couldn't find design patterns for unreal blueprints
## Week 4

Comp 130 Told us about game engines and frame rates. It was good to how the engine works and how unreal differs from unity, but I couldn't find where this would be useful for the projects I am currently working on

For comp 140 we submitted our adruino game pitches, but its kind of hard to do that without knowing what an adruino is and how it works. So I came up with a car jacking game because thats all I have is a breadboard and a bunch of wires, Ill figure out how it should work at some point.

## Week 5

Comp 130 we had a guest lecturer from metagame institute talking about AI, it was a very interesting lecture. Talking about how AI can be used and what kind of results you should be looking for when you do make and AI. 

Comp 140 We were told that next week we would be introduced to adruinos, about time.

Comp 160 We were introduced to SQL databases, building websites I was already familliar with the basics of SQL and how the databases work. But working with SQL after knowing more about programming was a completely new experience. Before this I just knew I need to do this to do this. But now I was able to compare SQL code to an example from C++ or python, knowing things like what is and if statement for SQL etc.

## Week 6

Comp 130 Guest lecture with Pete Ivey and James Clewett. Pete talked about the video game industry and the structure of how stuff works
James Clewett talked about simulation, and how we could use some simple algorithms to make something look random but realistic, Things like the drunk man algorithm etc.

Comp 140 We worked with adruinos. I found out how I will do my controller for the Hacking game, by using the same concept of lighting a simple LED I can use the touching of two wires as car hotwiring. And the connection will work as a simple input button.

Comp 160 We worked on the server, a lot of time was wasted just setting up the server.

## Week 7

Comp 130 We had a lecture about marketing, I don't think I learned anything more than I already knew, from multimedia marketing.

Comp 140 I worked on the game I spent too much time on the graphics when that is the only thing that is not being graded at all so I feel like I wasted some time, but I am also happy how my game looks.

Comp 160 We finished working on the server And got the highscore posting to the server, I can see how I could use this, but I feel like there are easier ways to do this using something like Wordpress and a few plugins.

## Week 8

Comp 130 We had a lecture on game analytics, And how we could read statistics by tracking some simple variables in our games, and how these analytics are tracked by AAA studios, and how powerful the could be. There was also something I was very familliar with is A/B testing from web development and the psychology behind color.

Comp 140 I finished the hacking game for the VIVA I still need to add randomization for the wires and explain the controls visually.

Comp 160 Show and tell day. It was really great seeing everyones games, and not just the first years, its amazing what the second years have done and what we have to follow during second year. I didnt really enjoy our trailer, because it was filmed from the the editor window and the cut down, so it really didnt represent our game very well.

## Week 9

Comp 140 The hacking handin was extended to 10PM, but I don't know if it will count. I could have submitted a lesser version of my game at 5pm. But I was having some bugs adding the randomization and submitted my game at 6pm. But if its going to be marked as an late submission its was all for nothing.

Comp 160 I hadn't done much for the essay, but reading and talking to other people about their essays gave me some insight into how I should approach my essay.

## Week 10

Comp 130 was a talk on Post mortems, what they are used for and how they are used in the industry. It was more for the BAs because they have to do a post morem on our group project, that we wont be a part of.

Comp 160 was analysis of software quality, we researched unit testing practices, but it seems most of the students minds are already starting to wander and not much was done in the lecture.

## Week 11

Comp 130 introduced the Summer project we will be working on, creating our own world. Very interesting lecture outlining what a world is and definitely gave me inspiration and ideas to create our own world ideas.

Comp 140, I Started work on my controller the main hurdle I hit was that I still didn't quite know how the adruino works in its interty and at first when thinking about the controler, I thought I would be as simple as plugin in 6 wires in the digital pins and 6 wires in the bread board but how my game is made, I need to know what wire is touching what. So I had to brainstorm how to achieve this.

I reasearched and found that the analog pins can read a voltage so in a bread board if i plug a wire right after the main "colored" wire and link it to A0-A5 ports I can achieve what I want, because if the analog pin is recieving any voltage that means that wire is touching a wire from the digital pins
