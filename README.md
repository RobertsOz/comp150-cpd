# comp150-cpd

## Week 1

* Overwhelmed by the assignment briefs.
* Getting back into Student life

## Week 2

* Getting to know my course mates.
* No issues arise.

## Week 3

* Getting used to programming in Python.
* I am familliar with Agile from previous studies.
* Recalling the Computing basics.

## Week 4

* Overwhelmed by thinkering graphics, feel like I was thrown in the deep end without a paddle
* Getting used to git, It works differently on my Mac, have to get a hang of it.

## Week 5

* Computing principles are up to where I left off in my previous studies now I can suppliment my learning.
* Im still overwhelmed by thinkering graphics, because we are using ideas we only recenlty learned in python.
* Am comfortable with presenting, need to do more preperations before hand.

## Week 6

* Computing Principles are getting interesting.
* I am a week behind in the thinkering graphics will read Sweigart to catch up.
* Troubles focusing on scholarly writing.

## Week 7

* Am comfortable with Computing Principles.
* Have caught up with Tinkering Graphics, dissapointed in the ammount of work put into the project due to falling behind.
* I am comfortable presenting, but should prepare a script with bullet points.
* I did Worksheet D and didn't do an nxn board, due to troubles reading the assignment brief in time.

## Week 8

* Am getting into the rythm of tinkering audio, still not entirely comfortable with programming from the slides.
* I feel like I didn't do enough in the sprint review.

## Week 9

* Finishing the Tinkering Graphics I am now comfortable with programming in Python, I am better at following along during the lectures.
* Did work on team project, still need to do more.

## Week 10

* I am confident in my Tinkering Audio project, I have problems understanding what would be considered one algorithm.
* Need further learning to think of up new algorithms for Tinkering Audio.
* I am comfortable writing the essay, but I need to get the hang of academic writing.

## Week 11

* I am confident in the future in my studies.
* I have gotten into the rythm of the course.
* I need to focus on Futher learning and Planning ahead for Term 2


#Stage 2
## Week 1

I missed the introduction to comp 140, because the time table didnt say that it was a comp 140 session.
I had no problem with the comp 130 worksheet A it was fairly easy. Encountered no problems.

## Week 2

Week 1 and Week 2 feels like a buffer before the real course starts. With Comp 130 being an introduction to C++ coding standarts. Didn't quite understand what the UML diagrams would be useful for.

## Week 3

Week 3 we handed in the Mandle brot set worksheet. I had some problems in the beggining wraping my head around the maths of it and where should it go in code, so I looked at an example online just to see where the calculation is supposed to go. For the color we were allowed to take code from online as long as we commented where we got it from, it was difficult looking at someone elses code and figuring out how to use it. For the strech goal I managed to get the zoom function working but only on the first coordinate. For some reason whenever I tried to recalculate the coordinates after a zoom the screen would not go where it is supposed to, and I never ended up fixing this problem. 

We were give adruinos but told nothing about how to work with them so Im kind of confused what to do with them.

Introduction to design patters, Im very keen to finding ways to implement this into my projects, but I also couldn't find design patterns for unreal blueprints
## Week 4

Comp 130 Told us about game engines and frame rates. It was good to how the engine works and how unreal differs from unity, but I couldn't find where this would be useful for the projects I am currently working on

For comp 140 we submitted our adruino game pitches, but its kind of hard to do that without knowing what an adruino is and how it works. So I came up with a car jacking game because thats all I have is a breadboard and a bunch of wires, Ill figure out how it should work at some point.

## Week 5

Comp 130 we had a guest lecturer from metagame institute talking about AI, it was a very interesting lecture. Talking about how AI can be used and what kind of results you should be looking for when you do make and AI. 

Comp 140 We were told that next week we would be introduced to adruinos, about time.

Comp 160 We were introduced to SQL databases, building websites I was already familliar with the basics of SQL and how the databases work. But working with SQL after knowing more about programming was a completely new experience. Before this I just knew I need to do this to do this. But now I was able to compare SQL code to an example from C++ or python, knowing things like what is and if statement for SQL etc.
